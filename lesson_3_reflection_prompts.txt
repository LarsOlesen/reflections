When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To be able to access from different computers
- To be able to collaborate with others
- To have a backup of my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because I might be working on local changes, and remote changes might conflict with mine.
