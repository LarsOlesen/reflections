When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To be able to access from different computers
- To be able to collaborate with others
- To have a backup of my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because I might be working on local changes, and remote changes might conflict with mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are a github feature used to clone a repository hosted on github to a private clone of the original.
- Clones are git's way of copying an entire repository including it's history.
-- Clones can be local to local, or remote to local.
- branches are similar to forks, but do not clone the repository they start from.
-- branches can be local or remote on repositories.


- I would use forks when I want to clone a repository on github.
- Github does not allow creating repositories by cloning.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
- I think this is because it is then possible to compare the local state with the remote state.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

- Share a branch with collaborator.
- Send pathches.
- Pull requests is better.
- Pathces are probably more inconvenient.
