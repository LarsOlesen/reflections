When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- To be able to access from different computers
- To be able to collaborate with others
- To have a backup of my work

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- Because I might be working on local changes, and remote changes might conflict with mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are a github feature used to clone a repository hosted on github to a private clone of the original.
- Clones are git's way of copying an entire repository including it's history.
-- Clones can be local to local, or remote to local.
- branches are similar to forks, but do not clone the repository they start from.
-- branches can be local or remote on repositories.


- I would use forks when I want to clone a repository on github.
- Github does not allow creating repositories by cloning.
