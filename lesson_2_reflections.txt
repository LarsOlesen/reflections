What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

- git creates an initial meta data directory (.git)
- It is necessary in order to start using git on the files in that directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

- The staging area only contains the part of the working directory.
- The staging area can be prepared for just the changes needed for the next commit, while leaving other changed files unstaged.
- It enables the user to prepare smaller more logically separated commits, rather than oen huge commit containing several possibly unrelated changes.
